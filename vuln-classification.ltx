\begin{slide}{Vulnerability Classification}
Classify the nature of a vulnerability based upon the component affected. While the class will not be comprehensive,
it will explain a number of common vulnerability vectors and the factors which impact discovery and remediation.
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Vulnerability Scope}
Covered vulnerability types:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Software (userland \& supervisor)
 \item Language design concerns
 \item Network / Protocol vulnerabilities
 \item Hardware Architecture
 \item Configuration
 \item User / Social Engineering
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Software (userland)}
Key considerations:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Sometimes, design/impl under your control
 \item Exposure risk can be limited to user's access
 \item Code review where available
 \item Static analyzers, run-time profilers
 \item May use production environment
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Software (supervisor)}
Key considerations:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Rarely design/impl under your control (unless you are OS/driver dev)
 \item Exposure risk can lead to complete access
 \item Typically must recreate clone of run-time environment
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Language Design Concerns}
Key considerations:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Lead to frequent unintended vulnerabilities
 \item Influence coding habits / styles
 \item Educational
 \item Example: C vs. Ada
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Network / Protocol Vulnerability}
Key considerations:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Lack of input control by default
 \item Streaming rather than finite data source
 \item Concurrency
 \item Pass-through / side-channel
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Hardware}
Key considerations:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Development cycles
 \item Replacement cost
 \item Rarely design/impl. under control
 \item Opacity
 \item Physical limitations
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Configuration}
Key considerations:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Low remediation cost
 \item Typically entirely within control
 \item Documentation
 \item Training / experience
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Human}
Key considerations:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Human Behavior
 \item Sophistication
 \item UX pain-points
 \item Documentation / training
 \item Awareness
 \item Skepticism
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Cyber Attack}
Typically comprises two or more of these vulnerability vectors. The term "exploit" is used to describe
when an attacker leverages a vulnerability for unauthorized access or effect. As a noun, it is commonly
used to describe a program or method which can reproducibly exploit one or more vulnerabilities.
